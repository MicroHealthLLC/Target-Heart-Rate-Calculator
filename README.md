As part of any internship for an aspiring developer, they need a portfolio of products to not only improve their skills but demonstrate them for potential employers. You will notice, there is not a single ad here, simply an app created by paid interns that range from high school students to college students. Please show your support by downloading the application and leaving them meaningful comments to help them improve their skills and expand their portfolio for their resume. Though we hope many of them will be hired in our company, many get an amazing start in the industry by demonstrating their portfolio of products they developed which earns them higher pay and quicker hire.

Thanks for supporting Micro-Health Interns.
